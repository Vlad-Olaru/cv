          Contributing to the completion of a large microservice-based application for a global automobile manufacturer. This platform integrates
          connected vehicles with the manufacturerâ€™s systems, enabling remote commands, map updates, and data synchronization. Among
          other things, I worked on:
            - Handling secure data ingestion for vehicles, processing encrypted zip files to enable certificate-based secure communication
            - Synchronizing databases across multiple regions to maintain consistency and availability
            - Managing synchronous and asynchronous communication for data flow coordination between services
